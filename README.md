# xicvar-node

*xicvar-node* is a web server tool that allows to share genomic variants within secure private network of nodes. 
It consists of two Flask containers (variant-server and web-server) that work behind a reverse-proxy (nginx) that implements two-way TLS encryptation. Requests to the variant-server are encrypted with a certificate signed by the network's CA certificate. Client is also authenticated with a certificate signed by the network's CA certificate through nginx's "client certificate verification" directive. This implements a server AND client two-way TLS encryptation that secures any communitation between network's nodes.

*xicvar-node* has been developed for the Xarxa Interhospitalaria Catalana de Variants Gen√®tiques which was funded by a research grant from "La Marato" in 2019.

### Installation



### Configure network certificates
#### Creating the Certificate Authority's Certificate and Key
```console
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -subj '/CN=My-Own-CA' -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -days 365
```
* use a "very-long" passphrase to encript the key
* certificate expiration is set to 1 year

#### Creating the Server/Client Key and Certificate Signing Request
```console
openssl req -noenc -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out server-cert.csr
```
#### Signing the Server/Client Certificate Signing Request with the Certificate Authority's Certificate and Key
```console
openssl x509 -req -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=IP:<XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX>") -days 365 -in server-cert.csr -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out cert.pem
```
* <XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX> use the server's IP 
* certificate expiration is set to 1 year
